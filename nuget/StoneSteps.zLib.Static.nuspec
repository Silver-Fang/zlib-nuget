    <description>A zLib compression library for MSVC projects.</description>
    <releaseNotes>
This package contains zLib header files and static libraries
built with VS2019 for Win32 and x64 platforms using zLib's
build scripts in win32/Makefile.msc.

Note that Debug and Release configurations contain the same
libraries and debug symbols because zLib does not generate
separate debug configurations.

The zLib static library is explicitly referenced within this
package and will appear within the solution folder tree after
the package is installed. The solution may need to be reloaded
to make the library file visible. This library may be moved
into any solution folder, where it will remain when the
solution is reloaded.

Note that zLib library path is valid only for build configurations
named Debug and Release and will not be found for any other
configuration name. Do not install this package for projects with
configurations other than Debug and Release.
